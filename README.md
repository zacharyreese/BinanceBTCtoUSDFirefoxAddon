# Binance Spot Wallet BTC value to USD Firefox Addon
This is a Firefox addon that converts cryptocurrency asset value from BTC value to USD value in the Binance Spot Wallet

## Features

* Converts the BTC value of your crypto currency assets to USD by fetching the most current BTCUSDT price from Binance's API and converting the values.

## Bugs

* If you switch wallets, such as to margin wallet, by using the left-hand menu and switch back to spot wallet, you will need to refresh your screen to see the USD prices.

* Only way to switch back to BTC prices is to disable the addon
